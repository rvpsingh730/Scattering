<b>Data and Analysis : </b><br>
The scattering intensity for each different incident wavelength is measured which is given below in table.<br>

The scattering light intensity, I, is plotted against λ (wavelength of incident light) which is shown in the figure below. This plot fits very well with the equation, I=c*(1/λ)<sup>4</sup>, where ‘c’ is the fitting constant.

<b>Analysis : </b><br>
1. Determine the dependence of incident light wavelength on scattering light intensity. <br>
2. Check if it follows (1/λ)<sup>4</sup> dependency.
